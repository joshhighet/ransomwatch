Posts are organized by subject into user-created boards called \"communities\" or \"subreddits\".","message":"Operators broke into Reddit on February 5, 2023, and took 80 gigabytes (zipped) of data. Reddit was emailed twice by operators, once on April 13 and one again on June 16. \n\nThere was no attempt to find out what we took. \n\nThis is again another instance of Steve Huffman undermining his own agenda. He makes an effort to appear tough, but we are all aware of what happens to individuals like him when businesses go public. such as Adam Neumann of WeWork.\n\nI told them in my first email that I would wait for their IPO to come along. But this seems like the perfect opportunity! We are very confident that Reddit will not pay any money for their data. But I am very happy to know that the public will be able to read about all the statistics they track about their users and all the interesting confidential data we took. Did you know they also silently censor users? Along with artifacts from their GitHub!\n\nIn our last email to them, we stated that we wanted $4.5 million in exchange for the deletion of the data and our silence. As we also stated, if we had to make this public, then we now demand that they also withdraw their API pricing changes along with our money or we will leak it. \n\nWe expect to leak the data. \n\nPass on the torch, Spez, you're no longer cut out for this kind of work.\n\nA Mistake repeated more than once is a decision. - Paulo Coelho\n","logo":{"id":"/article-attachment/d3bed549-2472-4baf-bffb-8e3584a419c0/1fbf3587-07c9-4c6a-8e8e-a50c692c6278","title":"redacted","dt":1687037252669},"attachments":[{"id":"/article-attachment/d3bed549-2472-4baf-bffb-8e3584a419c0/4ae03e22-6c20-4925-9711-ab5653cb54ea","title":"redacted","dt":1687037261543}],"fileHosts":[]},"createdDt":1687037299700},{"id":"46de0873-2b94-4e12-8f30-3a281ee0bd57","title":"Bauer Built","previewContent":"blank","content":null,"publication":{"url":"https://www.bauerbuilt.com","country":"unknown","description":"All Data.","message":"!!!
