It was formed when Tempur-Pedic International, a manufacturer of memory foam mattresses acquired its biggest competitor Sealy Corporation in 2012.","message":"Dear Ladies,\n\nFor several weeks now, we have successfully infiltrated Tempur Sealy International. While we initially intended to keep this quiet, circumstances have led us to share this information with you today:\n\n\"Dear Mr. Vakil,\n\nSeveral days have passed and we've noticed that no formal announcement has been made from your end. This might suggest a certain level of discord within your leadership team. To aid you in the process of public disclosure, we are providing you with a few samples of what we've obtained. When you choose to disclose this information to the public, you can use these samples to accurately describe what has been taken. If not, we will take the initiative.\n\nPlease find enclosed below a preview of the items we've acquired. Remember, this is just a sample - there are plenty more datas involved.\n\n\nWe are waiting for you to make an announcement or to contact us at our email that we are messaging you from.\n\n\nWishing you a pleasant afternoon,\n\nDoe\"\n\nMo Vakil serves as the General Counsel for Tempur. We have had unrestricted access to his computer, including his communications with external counsel, BakerHostetler.\n\nYou might find it interesting that Tempur employs the services of ArcticWolf for incident response and managed detection. \n\nMoreover, they use the ArcticWolf EDR (Endpoint Detection and RESPONSE). However, their agent is merely a rebranded OSSEC. They didn't even go as far as changing the service names. Surprisingly, they also throw no shutdown flags on a standard service because they apparently couldn't afford a kernel driver.\n\nWe had access to Mr. Vakil and many other high-level employees after we extracted all their data. They deliberated to keep the incident hidden from the public (as referenced in my message above).\n\nThey pretended to overlook our emails for a week, but we were privy to the meeting where they discussed our messages.\n\nWe even sent them a sample of the acquired data unasked (on Monday). It remains untouched, we can see if it was downloaded, leading us to infer they're avoiding responsibility to inform the public. Just like they didn't announce anything until we blackmailed them into it. They don't give a fuck about you as consumers. Just that they fill their pockets.\t\n\n\nRest assured, ignoring us won't spare you from the consequences. We will retaliate decisively.\n\nWe have infiltrated their Dynamics AX servers, and other systems that hold PII: customer banking information, last 4 digits of card numbers for orders, names, shipping addresses, order details, coupon usage, internal banking transactions, and much more. Remember everyone, these are mere claims. Soon they can and will be proven. It's already been proven in Mo Vakil's private gmail account, along with other key players in this scenario.\n\nPerhaps Mr. Vakil is withholding this information from the executive team for personal reasons. Given his questionable behavior, it wouldn't be surprising.\n\nWe still maintain access to their systems.\n\nWe will act when least anticipated. While it may seem we've forgotten, we keep a meticulous record, and actions will have repercussions. \n\nThis is the outcome when you heed cybersecurity advice from individuals who underestimate our capabilities.\n\nConsider this your final opportunity to respond. You have been provided a link to a chat room to contact us for any further communications.","logo":{"id":"/article-attachment/8c3d13a2-7b16-4821-abef-b59bac4ecde9/e2cd81cb-3531-4c2f-aa8a-9aefe837d973","title":"redacted","dt":1691017010775},"attachments":[],"fileHosts":[]},"createdDt":1691017619817,"updatedDt":1691017619817},{"id":"0ac49118-e02d-4fdd-8fa6-3c0bfba449c1","title":"KIMCO Staffing Service","previewContent":"blank","content":null,"publication":{"url":"https://www.kimco.com","country":"unknown","description":"We have helped more than 212,000 people find employment since 1986.
