ATTENTION PRESTIGE MAINTENANCE USA CUSTOMERS !!!\n\n!!! PRESTIGE MAINTENANCE USA HAS LEAKED YOUR DATA, IT WILL BE USED FOR VARIOUS MONETIZATION PURPOSES IN THE NEAR FUTURE !!!\n\nPrestige Maintenance USA is a company that may end up leaking your confidential data.\n\nPrestige Maintenance USA customers also have serious risks of ending the relevance of NDA documents due to their leaking into the public domain.\nAs a result of the attack, a lot of confidential customer and staff data was leaked, including the following documents:\n\n- Contracts with various levels of customers (with all related documents)\n- NDA contracts with various levels of customers (including Apple and Coca-Cola)\n- Operating principles and business standards of the company (information useful for competitors)\n- Personal information (such data leakage that makes it possible to monetize it on the black market)\n- Financial and analytical information (over a long period of time, including accounting and tax records)\n- Internal corporate documents (providing an understanding of all the processes taking place in the company).\n- Databases and customer bases (data that can be sold)\n- Internal corporate information about the company's customers (allowing you to understand work patterns, facilities, schedules and principles of penetration into their offices)\n\nAnd other sensitive data.\n\nExamples of some random data from Prestige Maintenance USA can be found at (TOR link):\n\nhttp://bvn5r7dzfdn2k2wcv7ifwtvi37zsm5kxv776nqw5lh7hwr4gd7msyhyd.onion\n\nThis blog is currently private and available only to Prestige Maintenance USA, but within 72 hours of the attack it will be published on our platform and seen by the thousands of journalists who read our blog.\n\nIf Prestige Maintenance USA management does not contact us within 72 hours or ignores this message, steps will be taken to further attack their business:\n\n- Customer and employee personal information will be sold and monetized, and all individuals involved will be informed of the leak and sale of their data\n- All customers of the company will be notified of the data leak related to their company and that Prestige Maintenance USA has not tried to stop it\n- All internal company information, including document workflows and business processes will be sent to competitors (A&S TOTAL CLEANING, Cleanstar National, Grosvenor Services and many other competitors)\n- Additional newsletters and media outlets in the U.S. will be sent regarding the incident\n- Further attacks will be launched against Prestige Maintenance USA and their partners\n\nPrestige Maintenance USA management has 72 hours to contact us, follow our instructions, allow us to quickly restore encrypted data to their system, and protect their business, employee, customer and partner data from leakage.\n\nAlso, within 72 hours of an attack, Prestige Maintenance USA has an excellent chance to learn about the many vulnerabilities in their network and get advice on how to fix them from us as professionals in the field.\n\nWe recommend that Prestige Maintenance USA management not waste their time and make the right choice, on which not only their future depends.","logo":{"id":"/article-attachment/5b41206b-dbf2-43c0-94f1-380707de8e14/e5780933-5769-423e-bfb7-e0ea4c7ea3a0","title":"redacted","dt":1676378726231},"attachments":[{"id":"/article-attachment/5b41206b-dbf2-43c0-94f1-380707de8e14/87017ee5-4701-42b9-ae73-1bfb543e0d4b","title":"redacted","dt":1676378845353},{"id":"/article-attachment/5b41206b-dbf2-43c0-94f1-380707de8e14/1b668dfd-2cae-4f3c-b73e-3b6ddb6092ca","title":"redacted","dt":1676378956274},{"id":"/article-attachment/5b41206b-dbf2-43c0-94f1-380707de8e14/1e322bae-01b7-4b03-81b7-b91ee17bebde","title":"redacted","dt":1676379005073},{"id":"/article-attachment/5b41206b-dbf2-43c0-94f1-380707de8e14/4510c1d2-8e8f-4eb8-950b-4813a55b94dc","title":"redacted","dt":1676379027046},{"id":"/article-attachment/5b41206b-dbf2-43c0-94f1-380707de8e14/1caac8bb-808a-4b69-a78b-10b6eb9ffb34","title":"redacted","dt":1676379047032},{"id":"/article-attachment/5b41206b-dbf2-43c0-94f1-380707de8e14/3b14aa2c-6518-4527-9104-d54f6182cab0","title":"redacted","dt":1676379070140},{"id":"/article-attachment/5b41206b-dbf2-43c0-94f1-380707de8e14/d745c84c-41c4-477c-b457-a92330e1e5ab","title":"redacted","dt":1676379113723},{"id":"/article-attachment/5b41206b-dbf2-43c0-94f1-380707de8e14/d1037c4d-2c87-4356-8f05-bfcb48e0114b","title":"redacted","dt":1676379141850},{"id":"/article-attachment/5b41206b-dbf2-43c0-94f1-380707de8e14/6d8ea479-e772-4195-b9ed-13a83a7e6db6","title":"redacted","dt":1676379172149},{"id":"/article-attachment/5b41206b-dbf2-43c0-94f1-380707de8e14/b8174f7b-c53a-422f-a25c-b1a625d61c6d","title":"redacted","dt":1676379195913},{"id":"/article-attachment/5b41206b-dbf2-43c0-94f1-380707de8e14/658a0835-bb7f-42b5-9e10-535b65201034","title":"redacted","dt":1676379222487},{"id":"/article-attachment/5b41206b-dbf2-43c0-94f1-380707de8e14/ec07bb3e-2753-4006-892a-3e2ce93e5ac2","title":"redacted","dt":1676379242368},{"id":"/article-attachment/5b41206b-dbf2-43c0-94f1-380707de8e14/7453229c-046d-4ffb-b81e-45c716e4dd2a","title":"redacted","dt":1676379276644},{"id":"/article-attachment/5b41206b-dbf2-43c0-94f1-380707de8e14/897d7c66-5df7-42a3-bee0-b85240ad4288","title":"redacted","dt":1676379303390},{"id":"/article-attachment/5b41206b-dbf2-43c0-94f1-380707de8e14/e2c2fe16-32e7-4c01-9e83-02e60ef5dc57","title":"redacted","dt":1676379331945},{"id":"/article-attachment/5b41206b-dbf2-43c0-94f1-380707de8e14/0b76a63a-37cd-4344-8189-747e97d2665a","title":"redacted","dt":1676379358153},{"id":"/article-attachment/5b41206b-dbf2-43c0-94f1-380707de8e14/0dc192c4-6abe-4595-80fe-ee1d50a33315","title":"redacted","dt":1676379386250},{"id":"/article-attachment/5b41206b-dbf2-43c0-94f1-380707de8e14/c7bf0293-4bd2-468d-b71e-44b97a611896","title":"redacted","dt":1676379436864},{"id":"/article-attachment/5b41206b-dbf2-43c0-94f1-380707de8e14/abc87962-8cd5-4c9a-96e3-b7e9584a2c59","title":"redacted","dt":1676379500010},{"id":"/article-attachment/5b41206b-dbf2-43c0-94f1-380707de8e14/8b53d6d5-b6ea-4a0c-9ef5-45def424d245","title":"redacted","dt":1676379548748},{"id":"/article-attachment/5b41206b-dbf2-43c0-94f1-380707de8e14/b63df380-6e7e-41fa-afe6-e2b82789d32c","title":"redacted","dt":1676379580729},{"id":"/article-attachment/5b41206b-dbf2-43c0-94f1-380707de8e14/6457bc2a-0920-4d12-9353-08c6cdd40ec2","title":"redacted","dt":1676379609030},{"id":"/article-attachment/5b41206b-dbf2-43c0-94f1-380707de8e14/11672b96-ddd2-4bf0-a73f-36d774245dab","title":"redacted","dt":1676379637107},{"id":"/article-attachment/5b41206b-dbf2-43c0-94f1-380707de8e14/92c9e5cc-5658-482a-b2d1-03a9d9e5a87f","title":"redacted","dt":1676379670059},{"id":"/article-attachment/5b41206b-dbf2-43c0-94f1-380707de8e14/58dd5c96-1725-4fe1-8fc8-dad226acf94d","title":"redacted","dt":1676379697021},{"id":"/article-attachment/5b41206b-dbf2-43c0-94f1-380707de8e14/8292db6d-4a96-4a91-a129-287b0fb9f297","title":"redacted","dt":1676379718177},{"id":"/article-attachment/5b41206b-dbf2-43c0-94f1-380707de8e14/6f5e8b11-f6ca-46e0-ac45-0a502d2153a9","title":"redacted","dt":1676379974859},{"id":"/article-attachment/5b41206b-dbf2-43c0-94f1-380707de8e14/59e126ba-e489-457f-a57f-3b8cfc619098","title":"redacted","dt":1676379999209},{"id":"/article-attachment/5b41206b-dbf2-43c0-94f1-380707de8e14/610f93be-b09f-4f6c-a972-43a052577f96","title":"redacted","dt":1676380036208},{"id":"/article-attachment/5b41206b-dbf2-43c0-94f1-380707de8e14/d183bd1b-6ab8-4c77-8a52-a3a5b951564a","title":"redacted","dt":1676380086769},{"id":"/article-attachment/5b41206b-dbf2-43c0-94f1-380707de8e14/7c6c183e-bb22-4502-9fc8-e2ef686ae9d0","title":"redacted","dt":1676380106499},{"id":"/article-attachment/5b41206b-dbf2-43c0-94f1-380707de8e14/9a2490e4-3aa6-4a00-a474-46b8306b06d4","title":"redacted","dt":1676380164520},{"id":"/article-attachment/5b41206b-dbf2-43c0-94f1-380707de8e14/9ed3fb4d-ea6a-4df5-acb1-e6661607cd78","title":"redacted","dt":1676380192813},{"id":"/article-attachment/5b41206b-dbf2-43c0-94f1-380707de8e14/69cb9e51-3fcc-4b26-816e-3598c3907477","title":"redacted","dt":1676380246812},{"id":"/article-attachment/5b4120
