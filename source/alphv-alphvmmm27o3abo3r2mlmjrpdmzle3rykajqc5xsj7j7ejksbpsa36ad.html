It designs, manufactures and sells data technology products, including data storage devices, data center systems and cloud storage services.","message":"The last I recall we said something along the lines of \"I will fuck you until you cannot stand anymore\" I guess they thought we were surely joking.\n\nHe didn't get in touch or glance at the webpage. Don't be concerned, David. I'll dismantle your wealth now. You appear so immense and influential.\n\nBeginning next week on an unspecified day, we will share leaks every week until we lose interest. Once that happens, we will put their intellectual property up for sale, including code signing certificates, firmware, personally identifiable information of customers, and more. \n\nWe've seen speculation surrounding customer data. To clarify, we obtained a full backup of their SAP Back Office, which dates back to the last week of March. The backup contains everything and anything you could imagine from the beginning of their partnership with SAP. Industry Experts can explain to the public what a full backup entails. However, it's important to know that WDC discovered the breach the next day and canceled their SAP contract. As a result, their online store remains non-functional! Their average cloud spend exceeds 7 figures every month.\n\nThey tried to thwart our efforts to extract data from their Bitbucket several times, but this is the outcome when inexperienced personnel (buffoon Indians) handle network operations centers.\n\nHere are some previews, and we'll start releasing more content next week. Keep an eye out, everyone!  Do note \"Project Siena\" is the name of their cover up operation. Notice how they never told their customers about anything? Don't worry we're just getting started. There's many tales to tell.\n\nAs for Western Digital himself, the situation has changed: No more chance to chat us up to negotiation since you refused to do so the entire month. We know you have the link to our onion site. Approach with payment prepared, or fuck off. Brace yourselves for the gradual fallout. \n\nAnd a finally Ms. Tiffany Scurry, nice try to cover this all up, whore. What will you do now? Create another project name to lie to your customers? Companies like yours deserve everything that's coming to them. \n\n","logo":{"id":"/article-attachment/b3fef979-0d1e-4a41-9c16-71a75f7b1dda/12c4621a-855d-4717-b5ca-8c2eda5e04ef","title":"redacted","dt":1682677653952},"attachments":[{"id":"/article-attachment/b3fef979-0d1e-4a41-9c16-71a75f7b1dda/3027c5b9-df27-4a09-ac29-5351477ce1b4","title":"redacted","dt":1682717673882},{"id":"/article-attachment/b3fef979-0d1e-4a41-9c16-71a75f7b1dda/f995a6b4-5d27-4494-b2e2-ea1736d8818b","title":"redacted","dt":1682717691160},{"id":"/article-attachment/b3fef979-0d1e-4a41-9c16-71a75f7b1dda/00dd1a3e-5e39-4288-a550-b5ad765e5366","title":"redacted","dt":1682717706882},{"id":"/article-attachment/b3fef979-0d1e-4a41-9c16-71a75f7b1dda/bce8677d-29c9-4424-bf4e-f26be73c01ca","title":"redacted","dt":1682717732972},{"id":"/article-attachment/b3fef979-0d1e-4a41-9c16-71a75f7b1dda/ff70b768-3140-45d6-8fe1-7e1ca73c1086","title":"redacted","dt":1682717743733},{"id":"/article-attachment/b3fef979-0d1e-4a41-9c16-71a75f7b1dda/b4b22eb9-d890-4243-9c5e-3d219d1be625","title":"redacted","dt":1682717753891},{"id":"/article-attachment/b3fef979-0d1e-4a41-9c16-71a75f7b1dda/631935c4-afba-4e2f-a4c1-205660dbecf2","title":"redacted","dt":1682717763053},{"id":"/article-attachment/b3fef979-0d1e-4a41-9c16-71a75f7b1dda/e93e977a-76f6-488e-ae65-bf6743954edb","title":"redacted","dt":1682717774058},{"id":"/article-attachment/b3fef979-0d1e-4a41-9c16-71a75f7b1dda/1a42b49d-a782-4274-bef3-2ad66a82b61e","title":"redacted","dt":1682717788718},{"id":"/article-attachment/b3fef979-0d1e-4a41-9c16-71a75f7b1dda/364b0d45-6e45-4656-a40c-d200b79d9028","title":"redacted","dt":1682717799214},{"id":"/article-attachment/b3fef979-0d1e-4a41-9c16-71a75f7b1dda/9925edca-7928-4248-8f19-4bfd21e33ad7","title":"redacted","dt":1682717812861},{"id":"/article-attachment/b3fef979-0d1e-4a41-9c16-71a75f7b1dda/001c02be-5603-4eb3-9137-7a9b9bc8f22e","title":"redacted","dt":1682717825997},{"id":"/article-attachment/b3fef979-0d1e-4a41-9c16-71a75f7b1dda/ae2d658a-e0db-4bae-b717-eafb7b4aeaed","title":"redacted","dt":1682717836131},{"id":"/article-attachment/b3fef979-0d1e-4a41-9c16-71a75f7b1dda/b65410a2-e3db-4a9f-bce5-f5546b46c53b","title":"redacted","dt":1682717852043},{"id":"/article-attachment/b3fef979-0d1e-4a41-9c16-71a75f7b1dda/6ec62d87-583e-4b8d-ba5e-b4bd5f8eb9c7","title":"redacted","dt":1682717864939},{"id":"/article-attachment/b3fef979-0d1e-4a41-9c16-71a75f7b1dda/d7c5421f-e8c7-4112-9c89-b09bfc96e25d","title":"redacted","dt":1682717877101},{"id":"/article-attachment/b3fef979-0d1e-4a41-9c16-71a75f7b1dda/2d10e95b-ebb5-4b8b-80f6-ced50a46d59a","title":"redacted","dt":1682717898905},{"id":"/article-attachment/b3fef979-0d1e-4a41-9c16-71a75f7b1dda/d0cda8b2-8ecf-46d6-b538-7aa9b50bcbc7","title":"redacted","dt":1682717911699},{"id":"/article-attachment/b3fef979-0d1e-4a41-9c16-71a75f7b1dda/aed278f5-5c71-4802-8670-09872bb54884","title":"redacted","dt":1682717923432},{"id":"/article-attachment/b3fef979-0d1e-4a41-9c16-71a75f7b1dda/4dee79b8-2d9c-45fd-bf72-00228c346271","title":"redacted","dt":1682717935802},{"id":"/article-attachment/b3fef979-0d1e-4a41-9c16-71a75f7b1dda/8612dcf5-f690-4b58-abd6-4c58e7e3ba49","title":"redacted","dt":1682717946237},{"id":"/article-attachment/b3fef979-0d1e-4a41-9c16-71a75f7b1dda/559acc02-6a20-4089-a9a0-9f2154d3edd1","title":"redacted","dt":1682717958854},{"id":"/article-attachment/b3fef979-0d1e-4a41-9c16-71a75f7b1dda/992ef509-a637-4d68-9589-53146085df47","title":"redacted","dt":1682717970179},{"id":"/article-attachment/b3fef979-0d1e-4a41-9c16-71a75f7b1dda/644edc9c-1b59-4d85-a9ae-e3cd8cd5c9a9","title":"redacted","dt":1682717984147},{"id":"/article-attachment/b3fef979-0d1e-4a41-9c16-71a75f7b1dda/7599bf2e-015f-44ac-9499-6e1094dd637b","title":"redacted","dt":1682718000468},{"id":"/article-attachment/b3fef979-0d1e-4a41-9c16-71a75f7b1dda/e094d933-2d7a-4431-93f9-4ba1c939f0ab","title":"redacted","dt":1682718030969},{"id":"/article-attachment/b3fef979-0d1e-4a41-9c16-71a75f7b1dda/81b7bfd9-50f2-426d-8e05-81a07a3d5c2d","title":"redacted","dt":1682718056057},{"id":"/article-attachment/b3fef979-0d1e-4a41-9c16-71a75f7b1dda/07efa254-b3c3-457a-8bb2-2e3dc4fc25de","title":"redacted","dt":1682718068820},{"id":"/article-attachment/b3fef979-0d1e-4a41-9c16-71a75f7b1dda/2bf55d91-36e4-4504-b575-ee4ba1506124","title":"redacted","dt":1682718080673}],"fileHosts":[]},"createdDt":1682719840539},{"id":"ae2570d0-2d81-4825-b493-2f45b917ea6c","title":"hwlebsworth","previewContent":"blank","content":null,"publication":{"url":"https://hwlebsworth.com.au/","country":"unknown","description":"Despite what many law firm websites say, it can be very difficult to differentiate one firm from another.
