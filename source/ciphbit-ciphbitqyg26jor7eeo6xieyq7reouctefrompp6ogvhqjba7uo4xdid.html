            A.P.E.R.S is a 1901 law association agreed with the Ministry of Justice and authorized by the judicial courts of Aix en Provence and Tarascon. It is developing geographically across the entire extent of these two jurisdictions for the victim support service and within the jurisdiction of the Aix-en-Provence TJ for the judicial activity service.

            The association is responsible for caring for victims in 97 municipalities that make up the 119 municipalities of Bouches-du-RhÃ´ne, or approximately more than 900,000 inhabitants.

            It began operating exclusively with volunteers for the execution of judicial mandates (judicial checks and personality investigations). The necessary professionalization of the workers subsequently led it to hire socio-judicial workers, social workers, victim receptionists and clinical psychologists. In 1991, the victim support service and the criminal mediation service were created. The A.P.E.R.S is authorized by the Ministry of Justice and operates within the jurisdiction of the judicial courts of Aix en Provence (since 1980) and Tarascon (since 1997).

            Helping victims is today one of the priorities of judicial policies. These now give victims a set of rights. The A.P.E.R.S victim assistance service supports all victims of criminal offenses, natural disasters, collective accidents or attacks and all victims of particularly traumatic violent situations.

            Transterra Polska Sp. z o.o. is a dynamic international transport company, which is specialized in international trucking. In 2004 we started our activities and each year we realize a steady pace of growth. In the meantime we have grown until a fleet of 82 units and there are still lots off perspectives and challenges for further development in the future.

            Raymond Stolk started the company with a fleet existing of five trucks. The focus was on long-distance trailer transport between ports and train terminals throughout Europe and Scandinavia.

            In 2010 we reached the number of 30 running trucks, In 2015 we started our activities in ADR bulk and foodstuffs with the first five ADR equiped trucks with compressors. In the following years we will grow this new service

            We are experiencing steady growth and this year our fleet consists of 65 trucks of the brands MAN, VOLVO, IVECO and MERCEDES with an average age of 3 years and EURO 6 certification.
