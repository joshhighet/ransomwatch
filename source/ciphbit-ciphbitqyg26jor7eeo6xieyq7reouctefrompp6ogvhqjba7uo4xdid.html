          <p>A.P.E.R.S is a 1901 law association agreed with the Ministry of Justice and authorized by the judicial
            courts of Aix en Provence and Tarascon. It is developing geographically across the entire extent of these
            two jurisdictions for the victim support service and within the jurisdiction of the Aix-en-Provence TJ for
            the judicial activity service.</p>
          <p>The association is responsible for caring for victims in 97 municipalities that make up the 119
            municipalities of Bouches-du-RhÃ´ne, or approximately more than 900,000 inhabitants.</p>
          <p>It began operating exclusively with volunteers for the execution of judicial mandates (judicial checks and
            personality investigations).
            The necessary professionalization of the workers subsequently led it to hire socio-judicial workers, social
            workers, victim receptionists and clinical psychologists.
            In 1991, the victim support service and the criminal mediation service were created.
            The A.P.E.R.S is authorized by the Ministry of Justice and operates within the jurisdiction of the judicial
            courts of Aix en Provence (since 1980) and Tarascon (since 1997).</p>
          <p>Helping victims is today one of the priorities of judicial policies. These now give victims a set of
            rights. The A.P.E.R.S victim assistance service supports all victims of criminal offenses, natural
            disasters, collective accidents or attacks and all victims of particularly traumatic violent situations.</p>
