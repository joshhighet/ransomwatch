                                For several weeks we have been trying to establish contact with this company, but they resist, each time postponing the deadline. It could have ended for them a long time ago, but they brought it to this point with their silence. They absolutely do not care about the fate of people whose data was taken from their file balls, on which they store everything from names to SSN. According to tradition, what was downloaded:<br />350 gigabytes of data including:<br />SSN - more than 8000 lines, from employees to customers<br />Bank statements and financial statements<br />Driving licenses, including the owner of the company and his family<br />Addresses, accounts, transactions, and the like.<br />And a fairly large number of different internal documentation.<br />The data will be posted on the site after the timer expires.<br />                            </div>
