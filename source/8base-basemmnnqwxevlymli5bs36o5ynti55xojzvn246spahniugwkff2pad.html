                            Many people will ask why we are called Info Salons? Does it have anything to do with haircuts? This is related to our CEO Ms. Jo-Anne Kelleway's work experience in a French exhibition registration management company. The word "salons" refers to exhibitions in French. So Info Salons literally means information technology applied to exhibitions.<br /><br />Info Salons was established in Australia in 1990. At that time, Australia's convention and exhibition industry began to boom with the opening of the new Sydney Convention and Exhibition Center on the edge of Darling Harbour. Australia needs a professional data collection company to professionalize the convention and exhibition industry. Info Salons provided registration solutions for 10 shows in its first year.                        </div>

When Don Sr. retired, his two sons, Don and Dean, assumed operation of the company. Based out of Monterey, Indiana, the company was involved mainly in the sale and delivery of petroleum products to farm and home heat customers. Don became a Standard Oil/Amoco jobber and continued to grow his business until his retirement in 1978. In 1980, they relocated the business to its current office in Winamac.<br />(574) 946-4863<br />+1 805-279-8265<br />+1 574-225-1543<br />                        </div>
