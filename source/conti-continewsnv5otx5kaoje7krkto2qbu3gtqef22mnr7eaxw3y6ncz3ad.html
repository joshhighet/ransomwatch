The Group generates more than half of its premium income in CEE. VIG\u2019s operations are also focused on this region.

The Group pursues a multi-brand strategy based on established local brands as well as local management. Ultimately, the Group\u2019s success and closeness to its customers is down to the strengths of each individual brand and local know-how.\n\u2003\nStrong Finances &amp; Credit Rating\nVienna Insurance Group has an A+ rating with stable outlook from the well-known rating agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s, meaning that it remains the top-rated company on the Vienna Stock Exchange\u2019s index of leading shares, the ATX.
