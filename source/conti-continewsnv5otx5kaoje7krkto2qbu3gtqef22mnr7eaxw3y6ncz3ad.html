Looks like Europeans have also decided to abandon their manners and go full-gansta simply trying to break our systems. Well, its good to finally have a legit opponent; after all it gets boring when you only deal with chimpanzees whose top capabilities are scraping forums and indicting Iranian students who \"hacked\" once another election for fun.\n\nIn any case, most things you've heard in the news are simply disinformation.\n\n1. We are up and running, our infra is intact and we are going full throttle\n\n2. The reported 25kk which we \"made since July\" is straight-up BS - we've made around 300kk at least (suck this Twitter-hobos)\n\n3. None of the core info about our people or networks was revealed. The incident has been a good trigger for us to make all the necessary checkups, so now we are running more smooth and secure then ever.\n\n4. We will work on advancing our cause further and are adding new capabilities as we speak. The Neo-fascist alliance between the US and EU kleptocracies will not stop us. You have already built one Axis, and it didn't last too long.\n\n5.
